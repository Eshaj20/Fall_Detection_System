#Fall_Detection_System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Used Dataset : https://github.com/nhoyh/HR_IMU_falldetection_dataset

Trained models :
- knn_model.pkl (binary classification)
- knn_model_all.pkl (multiclass classification)
  
We have evaluated with different machine learning techniques like catboost,xgboost,KNN and random forest we have got a good accuracy in KNN which is around 96% using binary classification and 92% using multiclass classification.Tested the sampled data by creating a platform using  frontend(Reactjs) and backend(Flask) by manually adding the inputs. And also built a cross-platform mobile app (Android/iOS) using React Native with real-time fall alerts, SOS functionality, live location tracking, and emergency contact calling.
